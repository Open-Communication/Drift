**Drift** is an open-source social platform that puts **free speech** first —  
not corporate policies, not algorithms, and not censorship.

On **Drift**, you’re not going to get banned just because someone didn’t like what you said.  
If it’s not **illegal**, and it doesn’t violate the **U.S. Constitution**, it **stays**.

> No shadowbans.  
> No takedowns.  
> No silent flagging.  

Just **real conversation** — unfiltered, uncensored, and unapologetically free.
